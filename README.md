Dp71 in hematopoietic cells may determine key developmental processes.


## Methods
Data come from https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25158935/ - analysis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and four multipotent progenitor (MPP) populations.

## Preprocessing
Raw FASTQ files were aligned to Mus musculus genome reference (GRCm38 Ensembl version 100) with HISAT.
FPKM by cuffquant and cuffnorm.

## Analysis
DMD transcripts expression levels.
